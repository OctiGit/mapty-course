Map application to upload running or cycling exercises and point them into a map, with the info given. The application also begins with the user geolocation and when an uploaded exercise is clicked it can posisionate the pointer in the center of the map.

The language learned in this course's project was JavaScript.

This project was built by me, based on the online course The Complete JavaScript Course by professor Jonas Schmedtmann, who designed it and allowed me to use it for my personal learning and portfolio.
